Homepage
The homepage sets the stage for what the tool is about and invites users to start exploring sorting algorithms.

Hero Section

A clean, modern design with a headline like: "Learn Sorting Algorithms Visually"
Subtext: "Experience how different sorting techniques work through interactive animations."
A “Get Started” button prominently displayed.
Visual Teaser

A short animated example of a sorting algorithm in action (e.g., bars being rearranged as they’re sorted) looping in the background.
Navigation Bar

Links: Home, Algorithms, About, Contact, and a Dark/Light Mode Toggle.
Main Tool Page: Sorting Visualizer
General Layout
The page is split into three main sections:
Control Panel (Top or Left)
Visualization Area (Center)
Explanation Panel (Right or Bottom, collapsible)
1. Control Panel
Users can configure and control the sorting visualizer with interactive settings.

Algorithm Dropdown:

Dropdown menu to choose an algorithm (Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, etc.).
Array Size Slider:

Adjust the size of the array (e.g., 10 bars to 100 bars).
Speed Control:

A slider to change the animation speed (slow for detailed steps, fast for quicker demonstrations).
Shuffle Button:

Randomizes the array to be sorted again.
Start Button:

Begins the sorting process based on the current settings.
2. Visualization Area
The centerpiece of the site, where the magic happens.

Sorting Bars:

Vertical bars of varying heights representing the array elements.
Colors change dynamically during sorting:
Green: Sorted elements.
Red: Elements currently being compared.
Blue: Pivot or key elements (for algorithms like Quick Sort).
Dynamic Animations:

Step-by-step animations showing swaps, comparisons, and movements.
Smooth transitions with easing effects for better clarity.
3. Explanation Panel
An interactive guide to the algorithm, synced with the visualization.

Step-by-Step Breakdown:

Describes what’s happening at each step in plain English. For example:
"Comparing element 4 with element 7. Swapping because 4 > 7."
Algorithm Pseudocode:

A scrollable code block showing the pseudocode for the chosen algorithm.
Highlights the current line of pseudocode as the algorithm executes.
Complexity Analysis:

A concise summary of the algorithm’s Time Complexity (best, worst, average) and Space Complexity, with a tooltip explaining what these terms mean.
Additional Features
Compare Algorithms Side-by-Side

A split-screen mode to visualize two algorithms running simultaneously on the same array.
Dark/Light Mode

Toggle between sleek dark mode and a clean light mode for better accessibility.
Mobile Optimization

A responsive design with touch-friendly controls for mobile users.
Progress Tracker

A simple progress bar showing how much of the sorting process is complete.
Educational Mode

Step through the sorting algorithm manually with a “Next Step” button to learn at your own pace.
Sound Effects (Optional)

Subtle sounds for comparisons and swaps to add an extra layer of feedback.
Footer Section
Links to resources like articles on sorting algorithms.
Acknowledgments for any libraries or frameworks used.
Social media links and contact information.
Styling and Feel
Color Scheme: A clean, professional palette (e.g., blues and grays for light mode, purples and blacks for dark mode).
Typography: A mix of playful yet professional fonts like Open Sans or Roboto.
Animations: Smooth, non-distracting animations for hover effects and transitions.
This design should make the Sorting Algorithm Visualizer both educational and engaging, appealing to students, developers, and anyone curious about algorithms.
